# QueueAway™

**AI-Powered • IoT-Enabled • Blockchain-Ready Smart Queue Management System**

QueueAway is a lightweight, browser-based platform that helps people **never wait in line again**.  
It brings smart queue management to clinics, RTOs, schools, local drives, and small businesses — without extra hardware or complicated setup.

## Problem

In India and globally, people lose hours daily waiting in physical queues.  
Small service providers — like local clinics, school offices, RTO counters, and community drives — have no simple system to manage wait times.  
Queues become crowded, chaotic, and unfair (line-cutting is common), leading to frustration, lost productivity, and even health risks in overcrowded spaces.
